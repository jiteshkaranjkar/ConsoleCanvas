once the console application opens create a Canvas and draw lines and rectangles and fill the space using the following commands

for example - 
Command 		Description
C w h           Should create a new canvas of width w and height h.
L x1 y1 x2 y2   Should create a new line from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). Currently only
                horizontal or vertical lines are supported. Horizontal and vertical lines
                will be drawn using the 'x' character.
R x1 y1 x2 y2   Should create a new rectangle, whose upper left corner is (x1,y1) and
                lower right corner is (x2,y2). Horizontal and vertical lines will be drawn
                using the 'x' character.
B x y c         Should fill the entire area connected to (x,y) with "colour" c. The
                behaviour of this is the same as that of the "bucket fill" tool in paint
